Tao or Dao is a Chinese word signifying 'way', 'path', 'route', 'key' or sometimes more loosely 'doctrine' or 'principle'. 

ToDo: Flesh this out with examples and reasons. 

# Devlopment 

- Backup plan, and Git from DAY 1
- Version number should be easily accessible, if not visible on all pages.
- Use a auto incrementing build number. Never release two programs with the same version and different funcality. 
- Write enough documentation that someone not involved in your project can setup a dev environment and make simple changes/deploys/rollbacks
- Have a lot of logging, and a way of easily viewing/sending them. You can always turn logging down fairly easily, but adding it after the fact is a lot more work.
