Do you remember the exact date or time when you last switched on the computer ?
Here€™s a simple DOS command to help you out:
<blockquote>systeminfo | find /i €œboot time€</blockquote>
This will show the time when you last rebooted the computer.
If you want to know when you stalled windows on your PC
<blockquote>systeminfo | find /i €œinstall date€</blockquote>
