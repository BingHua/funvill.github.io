Who Shit, What Shit is a drinking game.

<strong>How to Play the Game</strong>
Everyone in the game gets a name which ends with shit (i.e. Â Batshit, Dogshit, Horseshit, Jalepenoshit) and all you have to do is remember the other persons name.

The drinking game starts when someone starts to tell a long winded story that includes the word shit several times.
â€œI was walking through the woods and it was some crazy shit, absolutely wild shit, i might have even been smoking shit, etcâ€¦â€

Usually the crowd eggs the person on. Â Then the storyteller will work in one of the group members names (eg. batshit) at which time the person has to say:
Player: Â Who shit?
Storyteller: Â What shit?
Player: Â "player's name..(e.g. batshit)
This goes on until someone makes a mistake at which time the person who messed up has to drink and then start his own story.
