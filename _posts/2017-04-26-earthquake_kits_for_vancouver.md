I live in [Vancouver, BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver), a city near the edge of two of these [tectonic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics): the massive North American plate, and the smaller Juan de Fuca plate. There is a pretty good chance that me and my loved ones are going to live though a large earthquake in my lifetime while living in Vancouver. 

> Research shows that there is a 1 in 4 chance that we will have another major earthquake within the next 50 years. [Source](http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/earthquake-facts.aspx) 

This lead me to build my own earthquake kits. Below is what is in my own kit
