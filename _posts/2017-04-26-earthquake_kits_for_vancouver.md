I live in [Vancouver, BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver), a city near the edge of two of these [tectonic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics): the massive North American plate, and the smaller Juan de Fuca plate. There is a pretty good chance that me and my loved ones are going to live though a large earthquake in my lifetime while living in Vancouver. 

> Research shows that there is a 1 in 4 chance that we will have another major earthquake within the next 50 years. [Source](http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/earthquake-facts.aspx) 

This lead me to build my own earthquake kits. Below is what is in my own kit based on based on the recommendations from the City of vancouvers [make a earthquake kit](http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/make-an-emergency-kit.aspx) page. I found that most of the items need, I had spares from previous projects. 

- $1.00 25ft of [Paracord](https://paracord.com/) - I also use paracord for many of my [decorative knot tying](http://www.animatedknots.com/indexdecorative.php#ScrollPoint) and [lashing](http://www.animatedknots.com/lashsquare/#ScrollPoint) projects. 
- $0.08 [Handheld compass](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/20mm-Diameter-Liquid-Filled-Luminous-Dial_60498838793.html?spm=a2700.7724838.0.0.sCZ7XX) - I had plenty of compasses left over from [the compass table](https://blog.abluestar.com/look-what-i-made-compass-table) that I made a few years ago.
- $3.00 [Flashlight powered by AA batteries](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/CREE-flashlight-tactical-Q5-powerful-led-flashlight-linternas-luzes-light-torch-zaklamp-taschenlampe-torcia-mini-lanterna/32661328827.html) - I have used these flashlights in a film project before. They are ruggeded and water proof. They take double AA batteries that should be easy to find even in a emergency.
- $6.93 [FM Receiver, MP3, LED, USB, Recorder, SD card music player, USB charger](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mini-Portable-dual-band-Rechargeable-Digital-LED-display-panel-Stereo-FM-Radio-Speaker-USB-TF-mirco/32736589000.html) - Super cheap but works. I tested this at 1 day of radio playback when fully charged. I filled the SD card with survival podcasts and some music. It uses the standard Nokia battery pack. I have a few hundered of these battery packs after the local Nokia devlopment house closed down, so I added a few extra batteries. 
- $0.50 [Emergency Survival Rescue Blanket](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Outdoor-Water-Proof-Emergency-Survival-Rescue-Blanket-Foil-Thermal-Space-First-Aid-Sliver-Rescue-Curtain/32687533870.html) - Cheaper when you buy 100x. I used them as reflectors in [infinity mirros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_mirror) and [home made blimps](https://hackaday.com/2013/11/16/13-homemade-rc-blimp/)
- $5.30 [18L Light Waterproof Outdoor Dry Bags](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/LUCKSTONE-8L-15L-Ultra-Light-Waterproof-Outdoor-Dry-Bags-Colorful-Folding-Portable-Packages-for-Camping-Hiking/32779776550.html) - I been using these for camping for years now. Even at their price they have not failed me yet. 
- 1.00 [Protective Gloves](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Protective-Gloves-Flowers-Can-Be-Digging-Labor-Insurance-Gloves-1607-Rubber-Protective-Insulation-Manufacturers-Direct-Selling/32774973703.html) - Great gloves, they have a good feel and rubber tips. Cheaper when you buy 25x
