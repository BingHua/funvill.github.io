Pig is a pretty simple game that I use to play back in high school. Â Back then I didnâ€™t know any of the history or importance of this game or why people played, it was just a fun easy game to me and that's all that mattered.

Pig is a jeopardy dice game. Â In other words, a game where you have to decided whether or not to jeopardizes your previous gains by rolling for potentially greater gains. Â The game was first described in print by John Scarne in 1945 (Scarne, John. 1945. Â Scarne on Dice. Â Harrisburg, PA: Military Service Publishing Co.) but was an original folk game with many variation in game play and rules.

Pig is often used as a simple and fun way of teaching probability concepts in middle school. Â What are the chances that you will not roll a 1 on your 1st roll; on your 2nd roll, your 3rd, 20th, or 100th roll? Â Pig is not only for middle school kids, it is also used in some college and university courses to teach probability, statics, computer sciences and cognitive systems (AI).

I have made a very basic online single player version of the game. Â Pig The dice gameâˆž

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 or more dice</li>
	<li>1 or more players</li>
	<li>a sheet of paper for keeping score</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
The player starts his turn by rolling a single die.
If the player rolls 1, the player scores nothing and his turn ends.
If the player rolls 2-6, the player adds the value to the turn total.
After any roll that the player did not roll a 1 he may stop to add his turn total to his overall score and end his turn, or he can roll again and try for a higher score.

<strong>Example of game play</strong>
Player 1 rolls a die and gets 2, his turn total is 2, he decides to roll again.
Player 1 rolls and gets 4, his turn total is 6 (2+4) he decides to roll again.
Player 1 rolls 6 more times with the series of 4,3,6,4,2,4 and decides to stop with a turn total of 29. Â 29 is added to the players overall score. Â It the becomes player 2's Â turn.
Player 2 rolls 5 times with the series of 4,6,6,6,1. Â If he had stopped at 4 rolls he would have had 24 points, but since on his fifth roll he rolls a 1 he loses all his turn points and it become Â player 1â€™s turn again.

<strong>Rule Variations</strong>
Hog variation: You may use as many dice as you like but if you roll 1 on any of them your turn ends.

<strong>When playing with 1 die </strong>
6 is bad instead of 1.

<strong>When playing with two dice</strong>
Doubles are good, count the total of both dice and double itâ€¦ 2+2 = 4 * 2 = 8 points for double 2s.
Double 1â€™s are very bad, you lose points from your overall score. Â Depending on who you are playing with it can range anywhere from 1-25 points. Â 10 points is the most common penalty.
Big pig: Â if two 1s are rolled the player gets an additional 25 points added to their turn score.
Skunk: Â Everyone starts be standing up at a table, as players hold or end their turn people start to sit down. Â The last person still standing gets an additional 25 points. Â This game is called skunk because you only play 5 rounds, one for each letter. Â The first round is called â€˜Sâ€™, the second is â€˜Kâ€™, etc.
