I hateÂ writingÂ this type of post, the review of all your failures andÂ accomplishmentsÂ over the last year. But review isÂ importantÂ its stops you from repeating the same mistakes and give you a direction to go next year.

This year I haveÂ traveledÂ to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.748995,-84.387982&amp;spn=0.332282,0.676346&amp;z=11">Atlanta, GA, USA</a> (<a href="http://www.bacnet.org/">BACnet Plugfest</a>)Â , <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Montreal,+QC+Canada&amp;sll=33.748995,-84.387982&amp;sspn=0.332282,0.676346&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Montreal,+Communaut%C3%A9-Urbaine-de-Montr%C3%A9al,+Quebec,+Canada&amp;z=11">Montreal, QC Canada</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Harrison+Hot+Springs,+BC,+Canada&amp;sll=45.508889,-73.554167&amp;sspn=0.280059,0.676346&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Harrison+Hot+Springs,+Fraser+Valley+Regional+District,+British+Columbia,+Canada&amp;z=14">Harrison Hot Springs, BC, Canada</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Calgary,+AB+Canada+&amp;sll=51.045,-114.057222&amp;sspn=0.502502,1.352692&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Calgary,+Division+No.+6,+Alberta,+Canada&amp;z=11">Calgary, AB, Canada</a>,Â <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Black+Rock+City&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=40.409448,86.572266&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Black+Rock+City,+Imlay,+Pershing,+Nevada&amp;z=16">Black rock city, NV, USA</a> (<a href="http://www.burningman.com/">Burning man</a>),Â <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=49.732247,-124.007921&amp;spn=0.032288,0.084543&amp;z=14">Ruby lake</a>.Â And a bunch of other placesÂ in-between.

I saw lots ofÂ fantasticÂ shows, far to many to list. To name a few;Â <a href="http://www.gogolbordello.com/">Gogol Bordello</a>,Â <a href="http://www.jackietreehorn.ca/">Jackie Treehorn</a>,Â <a href="http://www.amandapalmer.net/">Amanda Palmer</a>,Â <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadmau5">dead mouse</a>,<a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/">Bassnectar</a>,Â <a href="http://www.myspace.com/kraddy">kraddy</a>,Â <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krafty_Kuts">Krafty Kuts</a>,Â <a href="http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/">Chemical Brothers</a>,Â <a href="http://www.dresdendolls.com/">Dresden Dolls</a>,Â <a href="http://www.thedrive.ca/house-fest.shtm">in the house festival</a>,

I participatedÂ at <a href="http://www.burningman.com/">burning man</a> with its anitÂ cooperate, peace loving hippy festivalÂ toÂ protestingÂ at the media fuck fest that was theÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver">Vancouver</a> <a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/">2010 OlympicÂ Winter games</a>.

I joined VHS (<a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/">Vancouver hack space</a>) aÂ electronicsÂ group, where I can talk about tech, security, and other geeky subjects and learn from others.

I met a very special lady, who has made meÂ overwhelminglyÂ happy this year, and I have had good friends move away for better opportunities who I miss dearly.Â SociallyÂ this year has been aÂ roller-coasterÂ of ups and downs. Never have I ever felt so connected with a single person and soÂ disconnectedÂ with myÂ communityÂ at the same time.

New Skills
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_picking">Lock-picking</a> - I got the chance to see a guestÂ presenter that was teachingÂ lock pickingÂ at VHS over the thanksgiving weekend. He was aÂ securitiesÂ expert giving talks about how easyÂ cretinÂ types of locks and security features where broken. (physical andÂ electronic) He gave a 2 hour persntaiton on picking locks. I have picked up some <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/products.dx/category.829~page.1~pagesize.52~pagesort.relevence">lockpicks</a> from <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/">dealextreme</a> a few months ago, but never got around to playing around with them. I picked my first lock in 1hr and picked up a bunch of practice locks to play with. With practiceÂ over the last few month I can pick most normal locks in under 30 sec, and tougher locks in 5-10 mins. Its shocking how easy it really is to pick a lock. <a href="http://deviating.net/lockpicking/">Instructions slides, and more info</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/">Google app inventor</a>/<a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> - I beenÂ developingÂ a few simple Android apps using these frameworks. Google App Inventor is <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/playing-with-app-inventor-for-android/">very simple</a> and would make a good teaching tool for youths on programing but isn't that powerful. PhoneGap on the other hand is very powerful and a little confusing but you can make just about anything it in.Â PhoneGapÂ uses html and Javascript and can be used cross platform on IPhone and android as well as other smart phones.</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code">QR Tags</a> - As part of theÂ wheatÂ pasting and graffiti projects I learnt how to create QR tags so i could digitally sign the pictures I put up and give the viewers theÂ abilityÂ to see other projects I was working on.</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a> - I purchased a GPSÂ receiverÂ from <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">Sparkfun</a>, to work on my life tracking project that I abandoned. The GPS syntax was pretty simple to decode.</li>
	<li><a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> - I use it for the login system for most of my projects. Its easier and safer then implementing my own login system. This year I learnt more about theÂ internalÂ system so OpenID mainly for <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/our-privacy-policy-we-sell-your-data-you-get-our-content-for-free-deal/">stealing personal information</a>.</li>
</ul>
Things I have made/did or help make
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://raygunrevival.com/">Ray Gun Revival</a> - Our newest magazine joiningÂ <a href="http://www.everydayfiction.com/">Every Day Fiction</a> andÂ <a href="http://www.everydaypoets.com/">Every Day Poets</a>. It publishes 4000 word or less pulp science fiction stories paying pro rates. This project took a good 2 months of my time to get running. Launches inÂ February 2011.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cubeecraft.com/">Papercraft</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_model">Paper model</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami">Origami</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_folding">paper folding</a>)Â - VHS has had a few paper folding (modular origami)Â nights over the last year that I have attended. I have created a few interesting objects including this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wqv1KRC-l0">64 sheet star with no glue</a>. I plan to keep building different and more complex objects over the next year. Its a lot of fun.

	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-lapse">Time laps Videos</a> - I have beenÂ experimentingÂ with time lapsÂ photography after I <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/canon-s90-chdk-how-do-you-get-to-the-record-mode/">hacked my canon camera</a> to give it theÂ abilityÂ to run scripts. Â Examples: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wqv1KRC-l0">2010-Jul-19 - modular origami</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by9hxtOM8es">Long exposer roof top</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie5cNKt0S00">Time laps clouds across the sky. 1min per frame</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjaF4-5_uL4">Vancouver Car free days 2010</a>. The hardest part is finding something interesting to recored.Â I was originally planning on taking a photo a min of the entire trip down and back from burning man, but I was unable to find a way to charge theÂ batteryÂ of the camera for the entire trip. I have since purchased a 12v inverter but it was too late for this year.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.eastvanarts.com/2010/02/press-skyzoo-in-the-georgia-straight/">SkyZoo</a> - We played music and gave out ~2000Â <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazoo">Kazoo</a> on theÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyTrain_(Vancouver)">VancouverÂ Skytrain</a> during theÂ <a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/">2010 OlympicÂ Winter games</a>. It was a lot of fun and we didn't get arrested. It wasÂ organizedÂ by the talentedÂ <a href="http://zeeproductions.ca/">Zee Kesler</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatpaste">Wheatpaste</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti">graffiti</a> projectsÂ - After seeingÂ <a href="http://www.banksyfilm.com/">exit through the gift shop</a>, aÂ graffiti film about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Brainwash">Mr Brainwash</a> by <a href="http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=banksy">Banksy a street artiest</a> and the great work of Â <a href="http://www.lindsayjoyhamilton.com/blog/2d/memorial-to-the-unseen-of-the-streets/">Lindsay Joy Hamilton</a>, we decided to try it out our self. I put up about ~750 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bros.">Mario brothers</a> icons aroundÂ Vancouver over three months. I have since moved on to bigger wheat pasting projects and found a group to do it with.

	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_painting">Light painting</a> - After <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/home/">stumbling upon</a> <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/mear-one-light-graffiti-emily-wells/">some</a> <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/10/100-stunning-demonstrations-of-light-painting/">fantastic</a> <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2010/09/14/magic-ipad-light-painting/">light</a> <a href="http://lightpainting.org/">painting</a> <a href="http://vimeo.com/5966947">videos</a>, I decided to make my own. Using <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/canon-s90-chdk-how-do-you-get-to-the-record-mode/">my hacked Canon camera</a> I was able to take<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging"> high dynamic range</a> photos and extremely long exposure photos. I also started and never finished a processing app that would create <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/light-painting-with-processing/">live light painting pictures/videos</a>. My lightÂ paintingÂ projects soon feel to the wayside as other projects took up more of my free time.

	<li><a href="http://www.android.com/">Android phone</a> - I upgraded my phone this year to a Android smart phone and startedÂ <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/playing-with-app-inventor-for-android/">developingÂ apps</a> for it with the help of VHS.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.abluestar.com/utilities/color/index.php">ColorÂ survey</a> - A simple survey written in PHP designed to find out different groupsÂ labelÂ colors. Does age, sec, location effect how you see color, and if so how much. <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/color-survey/">More detailed description and results</a>. Take <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/utilities/color/submit.php">the survey</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.abluestar.com/utilities/data/">Sensor net</a> - I created 2 little sensors that read Â the inside and outside temperature and light. Connected them to a <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">arduino</a> and recored the values once a min. The reading where veryÂ interestingÂ until the outside cable wasÂ accentuallyÂ cut and I lost my readings from the outside sensors.
<a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/sensorNet.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1198" title="sensorNet" src="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/sensorNet-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.abluestar.com/utilities/cyoa/">Choose your own path</a> (AKA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">CYOA</a>) - Â Is a choose your own adventure like game where you are given choices on what the protagonist does after each chapter. You are able to add new choices if you don't like the choices available. Written in <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>.</li>
	<li>Life tracker - This was a project to recored my own moments with a <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Tutorials/GPS">GPS</a> over the entire year to search for patterns and reduce and refine my paths. I was alsoÂ curiousÂ to see how much ofÂ Vancouver I walk over in a year. When IÂ purchasedÂ my android phone I converted the project from <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> to Android. After building the tracking app I found that the GPS drained considerable phone from the Android phone. My battery life went down from about 12 hours of to 3 hours. After a few weeks I abandoned the project and didn't continue it.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaj3NPYRa8A">Meauloaf</a> - I helped a good friend of mine <a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/">Andrew LeBlanc</a> with a shortÂ horror film for the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/bloodshotscanada">bloodshots 2010 contest</a>. We got and
<div id="_mcePaste">honorableÂ mention for "<em>Best Gross out</em>". It was a great learningÂ experience and I can't wait to do it again next year.</div></li>
</ul>
LessonsÂ that I have learnt
<ul>
	<li>I have learned to fear <a href="http://flychicago.com">Chicago Airport</a>. I have never had a flight that arrived or depart from this airport on time. Â They cap all their power outlets so no one can charge their laptops or otherÂ electronicÂ devices with out paying for the privilege at one of their booths. But at lest their air port is nice to look at with lots of stuff to do while you areÂ waiting.</li>
	<li>In-EarÂ buds are good for short distances, anything longer then 4 hours and your ears start to get a cramp. After 8 hours they blister and cause great pain. For long distanceÂ travelÂ headphones are the way to go.</li>
	<li>Always make a development log of everything you do each day. There is no way that I will be able toÂ rememberÂ what I didn't last week let alone 3-6 months ago. Keeping a Dev log of what you change, new things, things removed, stuff learned has helpedÂ tremendousnessÂ over the past year.</li>
</ul>
This year has been pretty decent. I have not done as much done inÂ previousÂ years but I would say I am happier this year then I have been in a long time.

Goals for next year
<ul>
	<li>More projects. This year I mainly worked on a few key projects instead of spreading myself out. Well this worked helped me maintainÂ focus andÂ completeÂ polish more projects I missed theÂ abilityÂ to try new things and explore more.</li>
	<li>More documentationÂ of the process. I plan to make more posts on the process instead of just the finished product of my projects. A project that takes a few weeks toÂ completeÂ and work out theÂ detailsÂ shouldn't just have a post mortem.</li>
	<li>All failed projects should have aÂ post mortem. Why it failed, What I learnt, How toÂ improveÂ next time.</li>
	<li>Participation. Never say No without a good reason, Always be willing to try, Try things that you "Know" to beÂ impossibleÂ just for the learningÂ experiences,Â Participation in every opportunity.</li>
	<li>Take more photos of nothing. I haven't been taking many photos over the last two years as most of the time I would take photos at shows or parties as "memory photos". As I slowed down on the parties I also stop taking my camera out and reduced the amount of photos that I have been taking. Next year I will bring my camera with me where ever I go and takeÂ picturesÂ of anything thatÂ interestsÂ me.</li>
	<li>Clean andÂ organizeÂ regularity. This year my work space has been a mess. It takes me 10s of mins to find anything and most of my parts areÂ crammedÂ in to a endless stack of shoe boxes.Â Â This year I am going to spend the lastÂ SundayÂ of each month orÂ Cleaning andÂ organizing my stuff.</li>
</ul>
PredictionsÂ for the future
<ul>
	<li>Year of the App and Tablets/Smart phones. IÂ believeÂ that next year will be focused on App devlopment forÂ mobileÂ devices such as smart phones andÂ tablets. I will beÂ forcingÂ on the <a href="http://www.android.com/">android platform</a> mainly as IÂ believeÂ that it will grow to become one of the biggest players in the industry.</li>
	<li>IÂ believeÂ that there will be on mass mobile network device virus that will infectÂ hundredsÂ of thousands of devices that will force platformÂ developersÂ to tighten theÂ securityÂ models on their devices.</li>
	<li>3d printers are going to be a big thing this year as they become cheaper and easier to obtain. More people will have them and more source objects will be created.</li>
</ul>
Wow that was a big post. I'm probably missing a few things feel free to reminded me in the comments section.

Happy new year!
