This week I have working on the gantry system. TheÂ gantry system is used to move the claw around inside the Cube.

<a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/350px-Skycam_Husky_Stadium.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3270 alignright" alt="Skycam" src="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/350px-Skycam_Husky_Stadium-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a> I wasÂ originallyÂ planing on attaching the claw to 4 cables running to pulleys in each of the corners of the cube. The cables would be attached to four electricÂ motors. Just like theÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skycam">sky cam</a>Â that you can some time see at stadium.

<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3275 alignleft" alt="2013-05-05 20.19.34" src="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-05-20.19.341-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" />I ended up not using the sky cam and going with a moreÂ traditional<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Y_table">Â XY table</a>.Â With a sky cam I would have had to have four matchingÂ electricalÂ motors in each corner. To move the sky cam North/East/South/West you need to move all 4 motors inÂ sequence making it more complex of a system.

<a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/reference.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3271 alignright" alt="CoreXY" src="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/reference-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" /></a>I decided to use the <a href="http://corexy.com/theory.html">CoreXY</a> system for the claw's XY table. Its a brilliant simple system that uses cables with only two motors instead the normal 4 motors. The system does need 8 pulleys two work.Â Rotating both motors in the same direction results in horizontal motion. Rotating both motors in opposite directions results in vertical motion.

I added a shelf on the top north and south sides of the cube. The shelf will carry the X axis (blue) Â up and down along the Y axis (red) giving the system itsÂ verticalÂ motion. In the first picture you can see the wheels and the X axis bar.

I added the wheels to the X axis bar, installed the 8 pulleys and ran cabling thought the system. Using my fingers I pulled the cables back and forth to move the XY stage around. Everything worked!

Next I am going to add the motors to the gantry system and get everything moving around.
