<a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/thumbs-down-smiley-md1.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2785" title="thumbs-down-smiley-md" alt="" src="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/thumbs-down-smiley-md1.png" width="180" height="144" /></a>Me and my girlfriend where looking for a new place. She was searchingÂ <a href="http://vancouver.kijiji.ca/">http://vancouver.kijiji.ca</a>Â for ads and came across a <strong>"Rental Guide"</strong>Â ad, and contacted them directly asking for a viewing of the house. Instead of setting up anÂ appointingÂ for a viewing they sold her a service where they search other classified ad sites for you and give results that match what you are looking for.

There are a fewÂ problemsÂ with this;
<ul>
	<li>The ad/house did not exist, they are advertising a house that may have existed in the past but now does not exist and can not be rented.</li>
	<li>They bullied her in toÂ believingÂ that they can do a better job then she can by searchingÂ craigslist.</li>
	<li>IÂ believeÂ that they repost ads from other sites (craigslist) under their name on different sites,Â <a href="http://vancouver.kijiji.ca/">http://vancouver.kijiji.ca</a></li>
</ul>
They are a bad company that extorts money out of people that don't know any better.

<strong>*Edit*</strong>

It looks like they have <a href="https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=210715975">a bunch of numbers that they use for the ads</a>. Please feel free to block andÂ ignoreÂ any ad with the following phone numbers.
<blockquote>Since their primary phone # 604-299-8844 has been blacklisted, they are posting a few ads a day with the phone numbers 566-9189, 566-9589, and 566-9831. To avoid repeated flagging, they delete these ads at the end of the day.</blockquote>
