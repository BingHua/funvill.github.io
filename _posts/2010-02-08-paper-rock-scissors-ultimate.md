<strong>How to play</strong>
It's basically paper, rock, scissors. Â Same rules apply but if you lose you take a shot of whatever you're drinking. Â The only difference is that ties are actually good for once. Â If a tie happens, (eg. scissors vs. scissors), then no one takes a shot, but the next person that lose has to take 2 shots instead of one. Â If consecutive ties occur then they are just added until the next person. Â (eg. 5 ties in a row then someone finally loses, the person that loses has to take 6 shots)
