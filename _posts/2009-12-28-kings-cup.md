A classic drinking game that evolves filling a cup (the kings cup) with random shots of liquor for the unfortunate loser of the game.
As with all drinking games the point of the game is to get drunk.

<strong>You will need</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A large cup (must be able to hold several shots)</li>
	<li>A deck of cards (jokers removed)</li>
	<li>2+ players</li>
</ul>
<strong>Set up</strong>
Place a large cup in the center of a table with cards spread around it face down.

<strong>How to play the game</strong>
Each player picks a card from the face down cards and follows the rules below.
Once done the turn order goes to the left.
Mob rules â€“ majority always rules, if they say drink when or if you messed up, you drink.

<strong>Ace</strong>- Social, everyone drinks.
<strong> 2</strong>- Is for You, you pick someone to drink.
<strong> 3</strong>- Is for Me, you drink.
<strong> 4</strong>- Is for Whores, girls drink.
<strong> 5</strong>- Rule, make a rule everyone must follow until the next 5 is picked. Â If rule is broken, that person must drink. Â See below for example rules
<strong> 6</strong>- Is for dicks, guys drink.
<strong> 7</strong>- Multiples of 11, The person who picks this card begins to count.."1", the next person continues saying.. "2", and the nextplayer says.."3", and so on. Â As soon as you reach 7 (whoever it lands on), the player says "F*CK YOU!" instead. Â The direction then reverses (so the person who just said 6, now must say 8 and whoever said 5 says 9), and continues untill 11 is the number to be said and instead saying "F*CK YOU" and the direction again reverses. Â Whoever f*cks up...DRINKS!

<strong> 8</strong>- Donâ€™t be late, a.k.a thumbs on table or points to the sky. Â Whoever is the last to pick-up on the play must drink.
<strong> 9</strong>- Nines is rhyme. Â The person who draws this card will say a word, then the person to the right has to say a word that rhymes with it. Â This continues around the table until someone messes up. Â This person has to drink.
<strong> 10</strong>- Waterfalls. Â The person who picks this card has a choice of playing waterfall. Â That person begins to drink. Â The person next to the starter then begins to drink soon after, the player next to them begins drinking after the follower, and so on. Â The trick is you can't stop drinking until the starting player stops, then each player in order can stop once the player before them has stopped.
<strong> Jack</strong> - Go Back, the person before you drinks.
<strong> Queen</strong>- Questions (my personal least favorite). Â Player turns to the person next to them and asks a question (ex: Have you ever licked a donkeyâ€™s butt hole?) Â Then that person must turn to the next person and ask a relevant question (ex: Wouldnâ€™t a Donkeys butt hole taste like candy?) the person who fumbles drinks. Â Each question must be answered with a question!!
<strong> King</strong>- This is the kicker. Â Whenever a king is drawn, that person must pour however much of their drink they wish into the empty cup on the table. Â The person who draws the last king MUST DOWN THE KINGS CUP! Â You could see what chaos would occure with more than one deck and several diffrent types of booze!

<strong>Variations of this Game</strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">There are lots of different variations of this game, replacing some rules with others. Â Some of the more common rules that I have seen are:</span></strong>
<ul>
	<li>â€œLittle (Green) Man (Wee Man)â€ - Before a player takes a drink, he must remove a â€œlittle manâ€ from the rim of his cup before taking a drink.</li>
	<li>â€œDonâ€™t Break the Circleâ€ - The cards around the Kingâ€™s Cup must continue to make a circle around the cup through touching one another while people pull their cards on their turns.</li>
	<li>â€œNo First Namesâ€ - No using another playerâ€™s first name.</li>
	<li>â€œAristocracyâ€ - Whenever a player addresses another player by name, they must give them a suitable title, such as Baron or Lady.</li>
	<li>â€œDrink, Drank, Drunk (3D)â€ - No player may say drink, drank or drunk.</li>
	<li>â€œDyslexiaâ€ - All players have their names reversed, so, for example, Tom becomes Mot.</li>

	<li>â€œIn My Pantsâ€ - After the conclusion of any statement, a player must say â€œIn My Pantsâ€ or another phrase, such as â€œIn my bedâ€, â€œWhen Iâ€™m nakedâ€, â€œBecause Iâ€™m a slutâ€, etc.</li>
	<li>â€œFirst Personâ€ - No one can use any pronouns (e.g., I, my, me, mine, etc.) Very interesting when combined with the â€œIn my pantsâ€ rule.</li>
