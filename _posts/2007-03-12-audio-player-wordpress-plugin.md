Most Projects that I found where overly complicated and bloated with features that I just didn't need. I was about to give up and use Quicktime plugin untill i found <a href="http://www.1pixelout.net/code/audio-player-wordpress-plugin/">audio-player-wordpress-plugin</a> by <a href="http://www.1pixelout.net/">1pixelout.net</a> its exactly what I wanted a simple player with a Start and Stop button.

You can even use it on non wordpress site
