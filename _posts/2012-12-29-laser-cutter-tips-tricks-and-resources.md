<a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/220px-Counter_typography.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3109 alignright" alt="220px-Counter_typography" src="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/220px-Counter_typography-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" /></a>A few of my recent laser cutter projects, have required that I cut some text out of the material. When you cut in to the materialÂ using normal font like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial">Arial</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica">Helvetica</a>,Â the center parts of letters such as "O" and "P" fallout and looksÂ horrible. The inner parts of the font is called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_(typography)">counters</a>".
<blockquote>In typography, a counter or aperture is the area of typeface anatomy that is entirely or partially enclosed by a letter form or a symbol (the counter-space/the hole of).[1][2] Letters containing closed counters include A, B, D, O, P, Q, R, a, b, d, e, g, o, p, and q. Letters containing open counters include c, f, h, i, s etc. The digits 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9 also possess a counter.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_(typography)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_(typography)</a></blockquote>
To get around this you need to use a "counter-less" font or aÂ stencil/laserÂ safe font. Recently I have been using <a href="http://subsidiarydesign.com/stencilano/">Stencilano</a>. There are many otherÂ stencil/laserÂ safe fontsÂ availableÂ as well.

<strong>Note:</strong> This font will not beÂ availableÂ on most computers by default and you will need to download and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314960">install it</a>.
