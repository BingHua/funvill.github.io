In the year of 2015-2016 the Vancouver hackspace has developed a poisonous environment. The culture at VHS has gotten so bad that it is actively encouraging and rewarding bad behavior. I use to have pride that I was a VHS member, now I am ashamed to be apart of this group.

VHS use to be a place where people could ask questions and get help with there projects while helping out others. Now people asking questions get ignored, or worst ridiculed for asking a questions. VHS is no longer a friendly, welcoming place.

This is a list of the alternatives to The Vancouver Hackspace (VHS).
