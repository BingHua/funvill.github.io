Vancouver Hackspace (VHS) use to be a place where people could ask questions and get help with their projects, while helping out others. Now new people asking questions, at best, get ignored, and worst ridiculed for asking a questions. I use to have pride in being a VHS member but now I am ashamed to have been apart of that group.

Between the years of 2015-2016 the Vancouver Hackspace the board of directors ( *names removed* ) as well as a few other members ( *names removed* ) destroyed the existing community that took years to create.

Good, energetic, people will succeed anywhere. VHS is a handicap that prevent even good people from achieving success. Your projects will wither and die at VHS.

This is a list of the alternatives to The Vancouver Hackspace (VHS).
