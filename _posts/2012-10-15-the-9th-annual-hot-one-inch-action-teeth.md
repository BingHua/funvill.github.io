These limited edition buttons are displayed on the gallery wall and the audience is offered the opportunity to buy randomly selected buttons in mixed bags of five for $5. Didnâ€™t get the button you want? Trade with the people around youâ€¦ how bad do you want that button?! Thatâ€™s when the hot action starts.
