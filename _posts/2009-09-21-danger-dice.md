Danger Dice is a Drinking game

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>6 pint glasses</li>
	<li>1 dice</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
Set out the glasses in a line, arrange them from 1-6.
First person rolls the dice, whatever number comes up, thatâ€™s the glass they fill up with WHATEVER concoction they want, anything goes. Â Next person rolls; if they roll on the glass which is filled, they have to down it and roll again in order to fill up a different glass. Â The game continues, every time itâ€™s your turn you have to fill up a glass, this can mean that you have to down all six glasses before you land on an empty one.
