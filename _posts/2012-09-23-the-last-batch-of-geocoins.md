I was able to compleat the last bunch of GeoCoins tonight at <a href="vancouver.hackspace.ca">VHS</a>. These ones turned out better then the first two batches. I sanded the surface of the coins just a little to remove some of the extra burn marks. They made the lines lighter but a lot more readable.

I also printed the main two gears in theÂ <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27233">Nautilus Gears</a> from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com">Thingiverse.com</a>. I wasn't impressed with the source files and had to makeÂ multipleÂ changes to the files before i could get them to print right. I am planning on printing the backing plate tomorrow.

Here is small video of the Nautilus Gear working

I printed some other stuff as well, mostly gifts for friends and family. I am notÂ entirelyÂ happy with them and I plan on fixing them tomorrow.

I am almost out of materials and I don't want to purchase anything else until I get back from <a href="http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2012/index.html">World Maker Faire in NY</a>.
