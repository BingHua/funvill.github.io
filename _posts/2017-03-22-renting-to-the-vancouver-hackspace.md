If you are thinking about renting a building or a space to the Vancouver Hackspace (VHS), think hard about that choice. It could be very costly to you and your building. 

I was called to check the reference for the Vancouver Hackspace. Being a noteworthy member of the maker community they wanted to find out what I thought of VHS. The [Vancouver Hackspace is toxic, ill-manged non-profit society](https://blog.abluestar.com/alternatives-to-the-vancouver-hackspace), and you should not rent to them for the following reasons. 

Note: I will be updating and filling in this post over the next few weeks. 

## Space upgrades without permits

In 2014 the Vancouver hackspace moved into 1715 Cook St. The space did not have power outlets where they wanted them or a convenient 240v power source. After being warned by both the landlord and a few of their members they decided to install electrical conduit junction box though out the space without a city permits. 

Quote from a director at the time: 

> If the city ever finds out, we can rip them down and go back to using dozens extension cords and power bars.
