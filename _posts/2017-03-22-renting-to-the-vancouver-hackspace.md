If you are thinking about renting a building or a space to the Vancouver Hackspace (VHS), think hard about that choice. It could be very costly to you and your building. I was called to check the reference for the Vancouver Hackspace. Being a noteworthy member of the maker community they wanted to find out what I thought of VHS. The Vancouver Hackspace is toxic, ill-manged non-profit society, and you should not rent to them for the following reasons. 

Note: I will be updating and filling in this post over the next few weeks. 

- Garbage, recycling, bugs, and trash 
- Homeless, transients and open door policy 
- Fumes, Fires,  
- Absentee BoD, no accountability 
- Past landlords 
- Past financial statements
- 24 hour access 
- Noise
- Space upgrades without permits
- Insurance 
- Interactions with outher society
