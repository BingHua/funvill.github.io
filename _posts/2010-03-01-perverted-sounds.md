Perverted Sounds is a drinking word game.

<strong>What you need to play</strong>
<ul>
	<li>2 or more people (works best with 4-6 people)</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to play the game</strong>
You make a rhythm (either clapping hands twice and once on knees, etcâ€¦) Everyone sits in a circle, and every player has to think up of a personal perverted sound as well as an action for it.

For example: one can moan while closing their eyes and run their tongue on their lips, someone else can say â€œslurp, slurpâ€ and pretend theyâ€™re giving a blowjob. Â After doing your personal perverted sound and action, you have to follow it by doing someone elseâ€™s. Â The person to whom the latter sound and action belong to has to do their sound followed by someone else's. Â All the while they have to do this in rhythm. Â The rest of the group has to keep the rhythm as well.
Whoever messes up (like if they say a sound but do a different action) has to drink from a cup in the middle (filled with anything you like). Â Itâ€™s extremely hilarious, especially when you do a weird action that doesnâ€™t correspond to the sound! Â  It gets harder and funnier when youâ€™re drunk!
