<strong>Goals and Resolutions forÂ 2013
</strong>(<em>In no particularÂ order</em>)
<ul>
	<li>Create a new post for ABlueStar.com (This blog) each week. - Last year I only missed a few weeks and created a total of a ~47 post.</li>
	<li>Learn <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> using <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. Currently all my web projects are created with JavaScript and PHP. While there is nothing wrong with JS and PHP I feel that i am shooting myself in the foot by not learning one of the newest webÂ programmingÂ languages.</li>
	<li>Do 300+ <a href="http://www.geocaching.com">Geo Caches</a> this year. I just started Geo Caching this year duringÂ OctoberÂ and I have found a total of <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/profile/default.aspx?guid=ea926a4d-f0ec-430b-806c-62e22649e768">22 confirmed caches</a>. The number would be a lot higher if I would have started at the start of summer instead of fall. This also helps me get outside. It gives me a reason a quest to do.</li>
	<li>Create a <a href="http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm">open data</a> apps forÂ Vancouver.</li>
	<li>Make a board game/card game. After the success of <a href="http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Cards Against Humanity</a>Â on their recent <a href="http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/holidaystats/">pay what you canÂ campaign</a>Â as reallyÂ inspiredÂ me to make my ownÂ crowd-sourcedÂ board/card game.</li>
	<li>Start using <a href="https://ifttt.com/">ifttt.com</a> more to help automate my life.</li>
	<li>Create more sensors to <a href="http://quantifiedself.com">monitor my life</a>.</li>
</ul>
It looks like I have only ever done one post like this in the pastÂ <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/blog/what-i-did-in-2010-year-end-review/">What I did in 2010, Year end review</a>. It looks like I have accomplished all the goals I set out for my self in 2010, Woot!
