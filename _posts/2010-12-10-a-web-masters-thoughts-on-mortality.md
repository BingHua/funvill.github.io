As much as IÂ believeÂ that I am a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_complex">god</a> at programing and all things to do with theÂ microchip, eventuallyÂ I am going to die. I know it sounds <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ridiculous">ridiculous</a> but its going to happen. I just have to accept the fact that I am <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality">mortal</a> and plan for the future.

One of the things that I amÂ concernedÂ is after I die who is going to maintain all the websites and domains that I have started over the last few years. If I dieÂ suddenlyÂ and it was time to renew the domain on <a href="http://everydayfiction.com/">EveryDayFiction.com</a>, I would want one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder">my followers</a> to be able to renew the domain and keep my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy">legacy</a> going long after I am turned in to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">worm guts</a>.

For this reason <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_(law)">I wrote a will</a>, the will includes a database of all the domains, user names and passwords and people to contact after my passing. I also created a <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/utilities/death_clock/">Deadman's switch</a> that willÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man's_switch">automaticallyÂ send out a email</a> informing my friends, family, and followers that I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug">probably</a> have died and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_domination">what they should be doing in my absents</a>.

So fear not, I have thought what would happen after I am gone and madeÂ perpetrations so the world can continue without me.
