Some of the things that I have found interesting in February 2017.

## Tips and tricks 

* [Four column ASCII](https://garbagecollected.org/2017/01/31/four-column-ascii/) - A better way of looking at the standard ascii table. 

## Fiction 

* [Novel Updates](http://www.novelupdates.com/) - Human translated novels, Chinese. Korean and Japanese to English.
