## Articles

- [Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064177/) - Thinking this will prevent war, the US government gives an impenetrable supercomputer total control over launching nuclear missiles. But what the computer does with the power is unimaginable to its creators.
