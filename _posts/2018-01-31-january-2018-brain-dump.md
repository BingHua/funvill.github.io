Yet another [brain dump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_dump) post ([1](https://blog.abluestar.com/notes-from-may_2017), [2](https://blog.abluestar.com/notes-from-april_2017), [3](https://blog.abluestar.com/notes-from-march_2017) ). (*brain dump:* snapshot of the internal state of a knowledge database for transfer or archiving purposes) 

### I have stopped using Evernote 
I was a big fan of [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for a long time. The intergration with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and the dream of *Getting organized. Work smarter. Remember everything* was appealing. I spent 5 years using Evernote amassing close to 7000 notes. Scanning business cards was a killer feature for me. I was a loyal customer for a long time. As time went on other services started to pick away at my evernote mind share, google docs for notes, google photos for photos, [pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) for links, etc.. I found myself spending more time on orgnazation information (tagging, grouping, etc..) in evernote then I actually spent on retriving information. Then it started getting slow, evernote added more and more features that seemed to just slow everything down. The last note I put into evernote was in Dec-2015 and I didn't miss it when it was gone. 

### Are.na instead of pinterest
These days I been getting into making installtion art projects. I need a place to store the random source images. A friend of mine suggested that I take a look at [are.na](https://www.are.na/steven-smethurst). Ita s neat card base system that works well with photos, text and links. it supports social sharing of content and its fun to use. I always hated [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.ca/) but [are.na](https://www.are.na/] seems like a better choice over all. 

### Altenratives to TeamViewer
I have posted about my hate for [teamviewer](https://blog.abluestar.com/why-i-hate-teamviewer) and their horriable licence system before. A few years ago there wasn't many good alternatives to TeamViewer but that has changed. Now I am happy to suggest [Anydesk](https://anydesk.com/remote-desktop), and [Zoho assist](https://www.zoho.com/assist/). 

### Sarah Anne Johnson [FIREWORKS (2012)](http://sarahannejohnson.ca/works/fireworks-2012/) 
> Fireworks is an extension of the work I completed for Arctic Wonderland, and it was commissioned in 2012 by the Winnipeg Art Gallery for its centennial exhibition (Winnipeg Now.) The main element of this piece is the massive illuminated fireworks sculpture I created to hang from the ceiling. Inside are different types of lights that burst, flicker, and shine at various times and with vivid colors. Underneath this piece is a schooner that originally had figurines partying on it, but I later reconfigured it to be filled with fleshy silicon mounds. The whole piece is set against a backdrop photograph of the arctic, giving an ironic undertone the the celebratory jubilation happening with the sculpture.

Check out her website for a video. Its impressive. 

### PAPER CUT SHADOW BOX
Tutorial on [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Paper-Cut-Shadow-Box/)

Basically, paper cut-outs are layered on each other in a box with a glass frame. A light source goes behind the cut outs, and makes each layer glow. Generally, the more layers, the cooler the effect! I'll show how I made this shadow box, providing tips here and there. Feel free to give some input and tips (first instructable).

### [Furtherfield](https://www.furtherfield.org/)
A art and technology gallery, that has some interesting blockchain art exibits. I found out about furtherfield thou the [disobedient electronics](https://www.furtherfield.org/disobedient-electronics-protest-book-review/) book. 

### [Plantoids]](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/plantoids-the-first-blockchain-based-artificial-life-forms-1482768916/): The First Blockchain-Based Artificial Life Forms
A neat sculpture art project that uses the smart-contracts and the blockchain to recive donations. When it recives enugh money it commisiones another version of its self, replicating. 

> You canâ€™t buy a Plantoid because it owns itself. If you like a Plantoid, you can show it appreciation by sending bitcoin to its wallet. Once a Plantoid has earned sufficient funds, it chooses an artist and commissions the artist to produce a new version of itself.
