## Projects 

- [Google's AnyPixel](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/anypixel) - is an open-source software and hardware library that makes it possible to use the web to create big, unusual, interactive displays. Anyone can fork the code and the schematics to create their own display at any scale.

## Funny
