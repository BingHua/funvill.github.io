Some of the things that I have found interesting in April 2017. This page is updated throughout the month of April. See [March 2017](https://blog.abluestar.com/notes-from-march_2017) for the previous month.

## Projects 

- [Google's AnyPixel](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/anypixel) - is an open-source software and hardware library that makes it possible to use the web to create big, unusual, interactive displays. Anyone can fork the code and the schematics to create their own display at any scale.
- [Drinkable tequila cloud](https://hackaday.com/2017/04/07/drinkable-clouds-get-you-second-hand-drunk/) - The cloud generator uses ultrasonic devices to vibrate the tequila molecules until they form a fine mist. The mist is delivered outward towards the sculpture, where a delicious cloud forms. From there, the cloud literally rains tequila out into its original, drinkable tequila form

## Funny 

- [Burned Your Tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/burnedyourtweet) - A robot that burns the tweets from @realDonaldTrump
- [Tobacco smoke Enema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke_enema) - The tobacco smoke enema, an insufflation of tobacco smoke into the rectum by enema, was a medical treatment employed by European physicians for a range of ailments.
