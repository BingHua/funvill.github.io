Some of the things that I have found interesting in April 2017. This page is updated throughout the month of April. See [March 2017](https://blog.abluestar.com/notes-from-march_2017) for the previous month.

## Projects 

- [Google's AnyPixel](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/anypixel) - is an open-source software and hardware library that makes it possible to use the web to create big, unusual, interactive displays. Anyone can fork the code and the schematics to create their own display at any scale.
- [Drinkable tequila cloud](https://hackaday.com/2017/04/07/drinkable-clouds-get-you-second-hand-drunk/) - The cloud generator uses ultrasonic devices to vibrate the tequila molecules until they form a fine mist. The mist is delivered outward towards the sculpture, where a delicious cloud forms. From there, the cloud literally rains tequila out into its original, drinkable tequila form
- [espurna](https://bitbucket.org/xoseperez/espurna) - ESPurna ("spark" in Catalan) is a custom firmware for ESP8266 based smart switches. It was originally developed with the IteadStudio Sonoff in mind but now it supports a growing number of ESP8266-based boards. It uses the Arduino Core for ESP8266 framework and a number of 3rd party libraries.
