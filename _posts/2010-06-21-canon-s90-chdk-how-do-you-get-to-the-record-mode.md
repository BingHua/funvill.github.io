<a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/">CHDK</a> (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span></strong>anon <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">H</span></strong>ackÂ <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span></strong>evelopmentÂ <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">K</span></strong>it) is aÂ communityÂ build open sourceÂ alternativeÂ firmware for canon cameras. CHDK features are; RAW files, bracketing, full manual control over exposure, Zebra-Mode, Live histogram, Grids, and mostÂ importantÂ scripting.

Upgrading to this custom firmware can be tricky but they have tried to make it as easy asÂ possibly with theÂ <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK/Installing_with_Cardtricks">applicationÂ CardTricks</a>. I haveÂ installedÂ this firmware on several cameras with great success.

The upgraded firmware is a software hack and does not change your cameras memory, instead it runs off the SD card. If you don't want to use the customÂ firmwareÂ just format your SD card and your camera will be back to its default firmware.

The scriptingÂ allowsÂ you do to someÂ interestingÂ things such as time laps photography, super longÂ exposureÂ videos, motionÂ sensingÂ recording, ect...

When I upgraded my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_PowerShot_S90">Canon S90</a> firmwareÂ to <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/">CHDK </a>version 0.9.9.905 and ran in to a problem.Â When the camera stats up with the firmware enabled it starts in [playback] mode. When you click the [<em>playback button</em>] to switch it to [<em>recordÂ mode</em>] the camera turns its self off. After playing with it for a while I found a solution to the problem. When you want to switch from [<em>playback mode</em>] to [<em>recode mode</em>] Â you need to press the [<em>shutter button</em>] instead of the [<em>playback button</em>]. This is different then all the other cameras that I have installed CHDK on.
