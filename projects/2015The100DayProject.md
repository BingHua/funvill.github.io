## 2016 The 100 Day Project. 

> What Is the 100-Day Project? It’s a celebration of process that encourages everyone to participate in 100 days of making. The great surrender is the process; showing up day after day is the goal. For the 100-Day Project, it’s not about fetishizing finished products—it’s about the process.

Made with VHS's Laser cutter. 96 small triangles, 36 medium triangles, 9 large triangles. It took about 5 hours to assemble with Zap straps. I used a 4x8 Sheet of 3mm birch plywood and 250+ Zap straps. The idea came/copied from this burning man project form 2013 [https://wewanttolearn.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/fractal-cult/5](https://wewanttolearn.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/fractal-cult/5)

Made with the VGS laser cutter, 20x hexagon (6 sided polygon) taped together with a single light source. This is mostly me playing with light.
