## The 100 Day Project - 2015

> What Is the 100-Day Project? It’s a celebration of process that encourages everyone to participate in 100 days of making. The great surrender is the process; showing up day after day is the goal. For the 100-Day Project, it’s not about fetishizing finished products—it’s about the process. Source: [http://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days)
